# Walltaker Checker
The Walltaker client for Windows that allows you to acquire and set as wallpaper the image from your links on the walltaker.joi.how site 
 
**Instructions**

Extract the folder inside the zip file somewhere, start the executable and enjoy.

**Version**

This app has been tested with Windows 10

**Features**

It is a little window that stays always opened, with some info on it, like the image you have rn, who set it, and if it is working
so it can work even without changing your wallpaper, showing the image in it

- the my links button takes to links page and if you long click it you can change the link number
- the upper right ones set the image to fit or cover
- the set by button takes you to the setter page and the next button open the image on e621
- the stop button stops the client from setting the image to the wallpaper and change the wallpaper 
- the panic button changes the wallpaper and close the app
- the button near the panic one hides the image in the client

**Important**
The videos/ gif don't work
to change the link number you have to long click the my links button
to restore your image put the image you want to use when the client reset the wallpaper where there is the executable
